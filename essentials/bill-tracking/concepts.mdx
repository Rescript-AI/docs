Built for government affairs and regulatory change management teams, Rescript helps you efficiently manage and analyze legislative activity across Congress, all 50 states, and Washington, D.C. During onboarding, Rescript will assist your team in setting up folders, relevance criteria, summary formats, and metadata. As you pilot and evaluate our AI's outputs, our team is always available to help tune formats, instructions, and settings to make sure the platform is configured properly.

## **Folders and Descriptions**

Folders define the categories or issue areas you want Rescript to track. Rescript’s AI automatically evaluates all new bills and suggests if they should be tracked in each folder.

- **For companies:** Folders can represent key business areas that the company needs to monitor.
- **For professional services:** They can represent client groups, making it easier to track and report on relevant legislation for each client.
- **For associations:** Folders can align with member priorities, working groups, or policy domains.

Each folder requires your team to include a plain language description that clearly specifies the issues you want to track in your folder. The AI relies on this description when it reads a bill and suggests if it should be reviewed by a team member.

## **Legislation**

Rescript maintains an up-to-date collection of all bills from the 2025 legislative sessions. Bill data is refreshed every 4 hours to reflect the latest official postings on legislature websites. When you add a bill to a folder - via either accepting the AI's relevance assessment or manually, that bill is considered to be "tracked". When you deny an AI's relevance assessment without accepting any, that bill is considered to be "dismissed". 

## **AI Relevance Assessments**

Our AI uses human-like logic to review a bill for relevance to your folders. When our AI reviews a bill, it evaluates whether it’s relevant to each of your folders, based on the folder’s description and a set of instructions the Rescript team will configure for you. The AI outputs a relevance label (**Highly Relevant**, **Possibly Relevant**, and **Not Relevant**) and an explanation for its decision including references to the bill.

During onboarding, Rescript will create a sandbox of bills that you will provide feedback on to tune the AI's relevance assessments.

## **Summaries**

Rescript can write multiple summaries for each bill. By default, Rescript comes with a number summary formats that are automatically produced for each bill; however, we also give you the option to tailor specific summary instructions, formats, and styles to your specifications.

## **Metadata**

Metadata lets you add custom fields to bills — like “Assigned Subject Matter Experts,” “Priority,” or “Review Deadline.” You control the field names and approved values, ensuring consistency across your team. Use metadata to quickly filter, search, and report on bills based on the information that matters most to your organization.
