In this walkthrough, we assume the role of a policy analyst at a healthcare-focused trade association. Our core areas of focus are **dental insurance**, **telehealth**, and **rural hospitals**, and we've created folders for each topic. This guide walks through the end‑to‑end flow for reviewing changes that Rescript surfaces.

## Review changes: start-to-finish

<Info>
**What you’ll do:** Find updates → filter your review queue and save view (optional) → open a bill → review the relevance assessment & summaries → choose an action (Track, Dismiss, Mark as reviewed) → take action on this change. 
</Info>

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to your updates queue">
  You can open the review queue from 2 locations:

  - **Monitoring Center (homepage).** Use this when you want a view of everything that changed recently for all of your folders.
  - **A specific folder → “Changes to Review.”** Use this when you’re focused on one issue area.

  <Frame caption="Monitoring Center: updates from all of your folders">

    />
  </Frame><div className="mb-6"></div>

  <Frame caption="Folder view: updates scoped to a single issue area">
    <img 
      src="/images/folder-bills.png" 
      alt="Folder-level Changes to Review list showing bills and their update types" 
    />
  </Frame>

</Step>

<Step title="Understand the update types at a glance">
  Rescript groups items so you know why each bill is appearing:

  <Info>
  1. **Unreviewed bills** that the AI assesses as relevant to one or more of your folders (likely relevant, maybe relevant, likely irrelevant)
  2. **Tracked bills** with an update you want to follow (e.g., status change, hearing scheduled)  
  3. **Previously dismissed bills** that now have a new, unreviewed version assessed as relevant  
  </Info>

</Step>

<Step title="(Optional) Narrow the list with filters">
  Use filters to focus on the changes that matter most today.

  <AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bill-level filters (state, chamber, status, etc.)">
    - Limit to specific **jurisdictions** or **chambers**  
    - Show only certain **change types** (e.g., “bill status changed,” “bill moved chambers”)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Relevance filters">
    - **Keywords**: Require keyword matches when you have a keyword prompt  
    - **AI-assessed relevance**: Choose **Highly relevant**, **Maybe relevant**, or **Unlikely**  
    - **Tags** (if enabled): Filter by any applied tag
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer metadata">
    - **List** type: Filter by one or more keywords  
    - **Date** type: Filter with min/max and sort ascending/descending  
    - **Number** type: Filter with min/max and sort ascending/descending
  </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="(Optional) Save your filter view for reuse">

  If you’ve added filters you’ll use again:

  1. Click **Save as New Filter**  
  2. Give the filter set a descriptive name (e.g., “Nikhil's States”)  
  3. Later, select it from the dropdown to reapply filters in one click

  **Editing saved filters**
  - Select the saved filter, adjust the filters, then choose **Save Changes to Filter View** to overwrite  
  - To rename only, use the <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="regular" />  **pencil** icon  
  - To delete, use the <Icon icon="trash" iconType="regular" />  **trash** icon

  <Tip>
  Use standardized and descriptive filter names so your team can scan and apply the right view quickly.
  </Tip>
</Step>


<Step title="Open a bill and review the change">
  When you click a bill, review the key details:

  - **Why it was marked relevant:** Check the AI relevance assessments and explanations for which folder(s) were matched  
  - **Summary and significance:** Scan the summaries and use the Chat to dig into specific details
  - **Context:** Use the web search tool within Chat, review bill details

  **Choose an action:**
  - **Track** — Click  <Icon icon="plus" iconType="regular" /> for each folder you want to track this bill in 
  - **Dismiss** — Click  <Icon icon="minus" iconType="regular" /> remove it from your folder(s) to stop tracking (Rescript will resurface it if a new version becomes relevant)  

  <Tip>
  Add a note in the Relevance Assessment to capture why you made a decision for a given folder. This improves team alignment, documentation, and if enabled, can train the AI's future filtering.
  </Tip>

  ></iframe>

  <Check>
  You’ve taken an action on the bill (Track, Dismiss, or Mark as reviewed).
  </Check>
</Step>


<Step title="What happens next">
  - **Tracked bills** continue to generate updates (if desired) in your Monitoring Center and relevant folders  
  - **Dismissed bills** are hidden for the current version; Rescript can resurface them if a **new version** becomes relevant  
  - **Marked as reviewed** items leave your **Changes to Review** list for that bill/version

  <Note>
  You can always refine your folder's description and reach out to the Rescript team for help finetuning your relevance criteria and summaries during onboarding.
  </Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I don’t see any items in Changes to Review">
- You may have filters that are too narrow. Clear all filters or relax relevance from **Highly relevant** to **Maybe relevant**.  
- Check that you’re in the correct folder or use the **Monitoring Center** for a broader view.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Too many items to review quickly">
- Filter by **change type** (e.g., only status changes).  
- Apply **date** filters to limit to the last 24–72 hours.  
- Save the view so you can return to it without reconfiguring filters.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Items I dismissed are back">
- A **new version** or **new signals** made the bill relevant again. Open the bill to confirm and decide whether to track or dismiss again with a note.
</Accordion>
