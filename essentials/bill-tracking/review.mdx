**You can review new legislation in one of two places:**

1. Through the Monitoring Center on the homepage
2. Via a specific folder in the "Changes to Review" section

**\
Rescript shows three types of updates:**

1. Unreviewed bills that the AI assesses to be relevant to one or more of your folders
2. Tracked bills that have a relevant update (e.g. status update, hearing scheduled, etc.)
3. Dismissed bills that have a new, unreviewed version that the AI assesses to be relevant

In the folder view below, you can see each of these update types.

Filtering through bills and updates**

1. Bill-Level Filters (state, chamber, status, etc.)
   1. To only allow show specific changes in Changes to Review, select from the options present (e.g. "bill status changed" or "bill moved chambers")
2. Relevance Filters
   1. Keywords: You may choose to add an additional option to require keyword matching (if you have a keyword prompt) 
   2. AI assessed relevance: There are three options; "yes - highly relevant", "maybe relevant", or "no/unlikely relevance" 
   3. Tags: If you have tags enabled, you may filter via tag. 
3. Customer Metadata
   1. List type: You may add one or more keywords and filter by their existence. 
   2. Date type: You may filter using min or max date, and optionally sort in ascending/descending order
   3. Number type: You may filter using min or max number, and optionally sort in ascending/descending order

**Saving filters**

Starting from the default filter set, if you add additional filters, you will be given the option to "Save as New Filter". This allows you to save this set of filters as a group that you can name and apply in bulk later. To confirm / save the filter set, press "Save as New Filter" and give the set a name. 

To edit, simply select the filter via the dropdown and add/remove filters, you will be given the option to "Save Changes to Filter View". This will save the current selection of filters and overwrite the previous selection. To change the title only, press the pencil icon. \

To delete the filter view, press the trash icon.
